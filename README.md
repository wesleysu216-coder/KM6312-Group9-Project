# KM6312-Group9-Project
we use four crawlels to get the novel related data from JinJiang Novel Web.You can run them in sequence to get novel-1,novel-2,novel-3 and novel-4.
Then you can run EDA_1.py to transfer novel-1.csv into novel_processed.csv,run EDA_2.py to transfer novel-2.csv,novel-3.csv and novel-4.csv into novel_processed_2.csv.(all the data has been stored in data file, if you don't want to run these crawlers or data-processing python, you can directly get all the data you need in the data file)
Then you can run EDA_3.py to see the exploratry data analysis.
You can run KM6312\models.ipynb to see different classcial machine learning methods and their visualized results.(you can directly see these results in final_plots file)
You can run KM6312\MLP.ipynb to see the MLP model and its result.
